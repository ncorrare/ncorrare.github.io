I did a short presentation on how to automate the configuration of Arista devices with Puppet on the [Arista meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Arista-Networks-London-Meetup-Group/events/223573486/). Luckily I recorded it, for those of you who weren't lucky enough to see it live. Video of the screencast is below.
